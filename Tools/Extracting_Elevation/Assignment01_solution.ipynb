In this notebook, we provide you with basic functions for completing the assignment.  *You will need to modify existing code and write new code to find a solution*.

Each line of the file is a data record. Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas. The use of the comma as a field separator is the source of the name for this file format.\n",
    "\n",
